This document details the changes made to address client feedback regarding the Elite Auto Sales Academy Bot.

## Branding Improvements

1. **"Powered by AG Goldsmith" Tag**: 
   - Updated to use Elite's brand colors (#0D3B66 Blue and #FFD700 Gold)
   - Created a dedicated `elite-chip` class for consistent styling

2. **Brand Color Consistency**: 
   - Ensured consistent application of Elite's brand colors throughout the interface
   - Blue (#0D3B66) and Gold (#FFD700) are properly applied to all branded elements

3. **Fonts**:
   - Verified and maintained use of Montserrat/Open Sans font families across the application

## UI Structure and Navigation Enhancements

1. **Button Naming Standardization**: 
   - Updated all button labels to follow consistent naming patterns
   - Example: Changed generic labels (e.g., "!scripts") to descriptive labels (e.g., "Scripts & Templates")

2. **Collapsible Sections**: 
   - Implemented expandable/collapsible sections in the sidebar
   - Added section state management using React's useState hook
   - Each category can now be expanded or collapsed independently

3. **Visual Organization**:
   - Improved spacing and layout for better visual separation
   - Enhanced the sidebar structure to support future scaling of commands

## Coaching Layer Implementation

1. **Coaching Tips Component**:
   - Created a dedicated `CoachingTip` component for displaying quick coaching blurbs
   - Added visual styling that aligns with Elite branding

2. **Role-Play Depth Indicators**:
   - Implemented support for displaying role-play depth levels (1-3)
   - Added visual indicators to clearly show the current depth of role-play interactions

3. **Message Processing**:
   - Created a new `Message` component to handle complex message formats
   - Added support for extracting coaching tips from message content
   - Added support for recognizing and displaying role-play level information

## Special Formatting for Message Content

To add coaching tips to messages sent from the backend, use the following format:
```
COACHING_TIP:This is your coaching tip content with helpful advice for the user.END_COACHING_TIP

Your regular message content here...
```

To specify a role-play level (1-3), use:
```
ROLE_PLAY_LEVEL:2END_ROLE_PLAY_LEVEL

Your role-play scenario content here...
```

Both formats can be combined in a single message if needed.

## Future Considerations

1. **More Collapsible Categories**: As content grows, consider organizing similar commands into nested subcategories for better navigation.

2. **Initial State Management**: Consider which categories should be expanded by default when the user first loads the interface.

3. **Mobile Optimization**: The collapsible sections will be particularly beneficial for mobile users, as they reduce scrolling.
