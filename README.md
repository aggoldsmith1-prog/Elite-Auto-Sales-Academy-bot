#### Option A: Local Development with Streamlit Secrets (Recommended)

Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file in the project root:

```toml
# .streamlit/secrets.toml

# Google Service Account
[gcp_service_account]
type = "service_account"
project_id = "your-project-id"
private_key_id = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
private_key = "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
client_email = "your-sa@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
client_id = "1234567890"
auth_uri = "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth"
token_uri = "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token"
auth_provider_x509_cert_url = "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs"
client_x509_cert_url = "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/your-sa%40your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"

# Spreadsheet IDs
DAILY_LOG_SPREADSHEET_ID = "your-daily-log-spreadsheet-id"
SESSION_LOG_SPREADSHEET_ID = "your-session-log-spreadsheet-id"

# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_openai_api_key"
```

#### Option B: Environment Variables

As an alternative, you can set environment variables by creating a `.env` file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
AGBOT_MODEL=gpt-4o
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON='{...json content of your service account file...}'
DAILY_LOG_SPREADSHEET_ID=your_spreadsheet_id
SESSION_LOG_SPREADSHEET_ID=your_spreadsheet_id
```

streamlit run app.py
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:8501
